# WordPress to Laravel Converter

---

This is a package designed to facilitate converting WordPress to a Laravel App.
You would ideally use it in development to build any migrations, seeders, controllers, 
routes, and views.  It does not handle converting your themes or extra plugins.
Think about it like a simple CRUD generator to help you get a head start.
